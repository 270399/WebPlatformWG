## Distributed Meetings aka TelCons

WebApps has some irregularly scheduled *distributed meetings* (aka *telcons*). Below is common information and logistics for all of the distributed meetings and some meeting-specific information.

### General Information

The following information applies to all of Web Platform meetings (distributed and f2f):

-   IRC: server and port: <irc://irc.w3.org:6665/> ; channel is **\#webapps**
    -   **Each participant should type the following immediately after joining the irc channel:**
        -   `Present+ FirstName_LastName` (for example: `Present+ John_Smith`)

-   VoIP/Phone:
    -   For phone only access, the call-in number is always [+1.617.324.0000](tel:+1.617.324.0000); no international phone numbers are supported.
    -   For VoIP access, use WebEx; see the [WebEx FAQ](https://www.w3.org/2006/tools/wiki/WebExFAQ) for more information.
    -   If you're using an Android device, start the [<https://mit.webex.com/mw0401lsp13/wireless/callme.do?siteurl=mit&meetingKey=642208450&device=android&rnd>=-356349190 Cisco WebEx Meeting] app.
    -   Each participant should use a local mute button on their device to control their own audio.

-   Scribing: Invite [RRSAgent](http://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent) to the irc channel and follow [W3C scribe conventions](http://www.w3.org/2008/04/scribe.html).

-   IRC agenda management: Use the [Zakim-bot floor control](http://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot.html#speakerqueue) to manage the speaker queue and agenda items.

### Best Practices

-   [Uses IRC to facilitate meetings and create scribe an initial record of the meeting](https://www.w3.org/2006/tools/wiki/WebExBestPractices#IRC).

-   Each WebEx will open 15 mins earlier than the scheduled time.

-   **Submit a draft agenda to the group's mail list at least 24 hours before the meeting starts.**

-   **Submit the minutes to the appropriate mail list immediately after the meeting**.

### Web Interface to IRC

If you do do not have an IRC client, or have trouble connecting to IRC from behind a firewall, W3C offers a browser-based [IRC Web interface](http://cgi.w3.org/member-bin/irc/irc.cgi) (note: you must have a Member or Invited Expert account to use this).
